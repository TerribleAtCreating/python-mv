instructions for using audio visualizer

- make sure the presets and files folders exist
- the presets folder is where your render settings (excluding audio and output names) are saved
- the files folder is where you'll put your .wav and .png files for rendering

- your image should be 1600x900 or any downscale of it for that sweet 16:9 ratio
- when asked for a file name, include the extension
- use start.bat to instantly start up the visualizer in this directory

- extra: use fullscreen so that the progress bar doesn't duplicate; as of 2024 it can and will break in windowed
- tip: use "greenscreen.png" as the background image so that you can later edit in a video in a video editor
  you can also use "redscreen.png" or "bluescreen.png" if your editor allows for those effects
  you can also use "blackscreen.png" if your editor allows for color cutouts
  don't make a correct "whitescreen.png" file

- tip: use the "quick" preset to render videos with the settings i use

the bar fill color will be white, if you aren't satisfied with that edit the script yourself
the render speed is usually 30fps in the worst cases, so exactly 1 second per second with the "quick" preset
