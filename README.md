# python-mv
A small Python script for rendering music videos with FFmpeg.
## Module dependencies
### FFmpeg
This script relies heavily on the FFmpeg library.
You can install it at https://www.ffmpeg.org/. Install it by adding it to your PATH values, and you're good to go!

### Python-specific modules
- ffmpeg-python
- Pillow
- matplotlib
- alive-progress

If you haven't installed these already, an automatic (currently untested) module installer is included in the script.
I would recommend installing them manually though.
